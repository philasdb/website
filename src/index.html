      <h1> Welcome </h1>
      <p>Thank you for visiting Philadelphia Seventh Day Baptist. We consider liberty of thought under the guidance of
        the Holy Spirit to be essential to Christian belief and practice. Therefore we encourage the unhindered study
        and open discussion of Scripture. We uphold the individualâ€™s freedom of conscience in seeking to determine and
        obey the will of God. The following statement is not intended to be exhaustive, but is an expression of our
        common belief, which is derived from our understanding of Scripture. 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 ; 2 Timothy 2:15</p>
      <p>Keep reading for more about us. For information about Seventh Day Baptists in general, visit the <a
          href="https://seventhdaybaptist.org/about/statement-of-belief/">Seventh Day Baptist General Conference
          Website.</a> There you can also find other churches in the area, as well as learn about other Seventh Day
        Baptist ministries and events.</p>

      <h1>Head Pastor: Pastor Kenroy Cruickshank</h1>
      <img src="./img/pastor_portrait.webp" alt="Pastor Kenroy Cruickshank" width="180" height="180">
      <p>When I look back 36 years ago, it seems like only yesterday that I got off the plane and I was met by my wife
        Mauleen. As I arrived in Ambler, it was as if I was in a strange world. I could not understand the people and
        they could not understand me. However, I believed deep in my heart that I was called to start a Seventh Day
        Baptist Church in this area. The ministry is part of me and the conviction was deep in my spirit. Over the
        years, the Lord has blessed me with two children and a church. I accept the challenge to seek out new
        opportunities and ways of leading others to Christ in and around Philadelphia. As pastor, I invite you to come
        and worship with us.</p>

      <h1>Ministries</h1>
      <h2>Operation Christmas Child</h2>
      <p>Aiming to demonstrate God's love to children affected by war, natural disasters, poverty, famine, and disease,
        we have collaborated with <a
          href="https://www.samaritanspurse.org/what-we-do/operation-christmas-child/">Samaritan's Purse</a> to pack
        shoeboxes of essential supplies and gifts for children facing these unfortunate circumstances. When delivered,
        recipients also have the opportunity to learn more about Christianity and enroll in a discipleship program.</p>
      <h2>Nursing Home Ministry</h2>
      <p>We provide music for praise and worship and conduct a preaching ministry to the residents of the Golden Living
        Center. We have been involved with this ministry for 10 years, and we usually have approximately 30 residents in
        attendance each week. We also visit with some of the people who are bedridden, since they are unable to attend
        the church services. It is a non-denominational ministry based on preaching the Word of God for the edification
        of the saints and evangelizing the lost.</p>
