        Baptist young adults from Jamaica: Tawera Williams, a first-year Biochemistry student from Old Harbour SDB
        Church, and Daniel Williams, a first-year Medical student from Montego Bay SDB Church. They have been granted
        the incredible opportunity to participate in the Summer Christian Service Corps (SCSC) program in the USA and
        Canada.The SCSC program is renowned for its impactful work in leadership training, spreading the gospel,
        supporting local communities, and fostering spiritual growth. Tawera Williams; and Daniel Williams. Tawera and
        Daniel, both deeply committed to their faith and passionate about missionary work, have been selected to join

        However, they face significant financial hurdles in making this journey possible. The remaining cost for their
        participation, including travel, accommodation, and other necessary expenses, is $1,000 each. We are seeking the
        support of generous churches like yours to help make their mission a reality.

        We humbly ask for your church's support through a financial contribution to help cover these costs. Any amount
        you can provide will make a substantial difference and will be deeply appreciated. Your support will not only
        enable Tawera and Daniel to participate in the SCSC program but will also contribute to the broader mission of
        spreading God's word and love.
