  <h1>Pastor Kenroy Cruickshank</h1>
  <p>When I look back 36 years ago, it seems like only yesterday that I got off the plane and I was met by my wife Mauleen. As I arrived in Ambler, it was as if I was in a strange world. I could not understand the people and they could not understand me. However, I believed deep in my heart that I was called to start a Seventh Day Baptist Church in this area. The ministry is part of me and the conviction was deep in my spirit. Over the years, the Lord has blessed me with two children and a church. I accept the challenge to seek out new opportunities and ways of leading others to Christ in and around Philadelphia. As pastor, I invite you to come and worship with us.</p>
